Just a data parser I created that strips out all the random characters in a web scrape using
regular expressions and a MYSQL database. The script took a .txt file with no delimiters and
parsed it using regular expressions, then inserted it into the database. From there, I could export
the data as a CSV, all nice, neat and organized.
